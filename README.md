# simmelian-backbone
Python code to calculate a Simmelian backbone from a network edgelist
## Overview
This software implemenets an Simmelian backbone network analysis as described by [Nick, Lee, Cunningham, and Brandes](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262207813_Simmelian_backbones_amplifying_hidden_homophily_in_Facebook_networks) in 2013. The method has an almost magical ability to untangle "hairball" networks by removing links that are not part of embedded relationships. The effect is apparent in the figure from the Nick, et al., paper showing a large Facebook friends network:

Prior to this implementation, the analysis was only available in [Visone](https://visone.ethz.ch/), a GUI-based network analysis package. This Python implementation offers the same functionality for calculating the backbone as Visone, except as a stand-alone implementation that can be used for larger networks, in processing pipelines, etc.

## Credits

The code was written by [Suraj J. Unni](https://github.com/surajjunni). Specifications and testing by [Steve Corman](https://github.com/networks1). We thank [Julian MÃ¼ller](https://sn.ethz.ch/profile.html?persid=243533) and [Ulrik Brandes](https://github.com/ubrandes-ethz) of the Visone team for their assistance in understanding how to implement the Visone method.

## Dependencies
The code depends on the following implementations:
* Python 3.8
* [NetworKit](https://networkit.github.io/) 7.1
* [Numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/) 1.23.0
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) 1.4.3

## Running the Code
The code assumes as input an edgelist in .csv format. The first two columns of the .csv must contain two node labels that define the edge. Additional columns may contain additional edge-related atrributes (such as weight) but these are not considered in the calculations. The script will write to STDOUT all of the edges' input values with calculated backbone values added, depending on options selected.
To run the script:
>python3 backbone.py [--argument1=value, --argument2=value ...]

Where:
Argument | Description | Options | Default
--- | --- | --- | ---
edgelist | File containing the input edgelist formatted as discussed above. Analysis assumes network is undirected. | Valid path/filename | input.csv
method | Option to calculate redundancy values using triangles or quadranges. | triadic, quadrilateral | quadrilateral
threshold | Minimum redundancy % required to include an edge in the backbone. | Decimal value in range 0 - 1 | 0.02
multiedges | Whether redundant edges and loops are to be included in the redundancy calculations. | yes,no | no
connectivity | Whether minimal non-backbone edges should be retained to connect backbone components. | maintain,ignore | maintain
prune | Whether non-backbone edges should be excluded from the output. | yes,no | no
outputlist | Filename where the output should be written. | Valid path/filename | backbone.csv
