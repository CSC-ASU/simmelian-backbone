# simmelian-backbone
Python code to calculate a Simmelian backbone from a network edgelist
## Overview
This software implemenets an Simmelian backbone network analysis as described by [Nick, Lee, Cunningham, and Brandes](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262207813_Simmelian_backbones_amplifying_hidden_homophily_in_Facebook_networks) in 2013. The method has an almost magical ability to untangle "hairball" networks by removing links that are not part of embedded relationships.

Prior to this implementation, the analysis was only available in [Visone](https://visone.ethz.ch/), a GUI-based network analysis package. This Python implementation offers the same functionality for calculating the backbone as Visone, except as a stand-alone implementation that can be used for larger networks, in processing pipelines, etc.

The code was written by [Suraj J. Unni](https://github.com/surajjunni). Specifications and testing by [Steve Corman](https://github.com/networks1). We thank [Julian Müller](https://sn.ethz.ch/profile.html?persid=243533) and [Ulrik Brandes](https://github.com/ubrandes-ethz) of the Visone team for their assistance in understanding how to implement the Visone method.

## Dependencies
The code depends on the following implementations:
* Python 3.8
* [NetworKit](https://networkit.github.io/) 7.1
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) 1.4.3

## Running the Code
The code assumes as input an edgelist in .csv format. The first two columns of the .csv must contain two node labels that define the edge. Additional columns may contain additional edge-related atrributes (such as weight) but these are not considered in the calculations. The script will write to STDOUT all of the edges' input values with calculated backbone values added, depending on options selected.
